# SQL-Simple-Command-Sheet
I am deciding to create this because every time I look up some simple command sheet for SQL I can never manage to find a very simple, dumbed-down version to help me become more efficient at coding. I do not know about everyone else, but for me, I know what all the commands do. however, whenever it comes to remembering them off the top of my head Since I am new I still struggle and would greatly appreciate a place to go to just get a reminder occasionally. So I am going to slowly make a database of all the commands and what they do.

Then maybe  later create an example area for each command however I do not know if that will be necessary. 

| Command | Description | Example |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT | How you start off any query, Retrieves data from one or more tables | - |
